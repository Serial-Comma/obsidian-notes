# Pseudocode Syntax
### "because what's the point of making it simple?"

## Normal stuff

`DECLARE`
Syntax: `DECLARE <variable name> : <data type>`

What can you declare?

```C
INTEGER: 1,2,-3,0 //Basically Python int()
REAL: 4.7, 6.9, 3.141592654 //It's not float() because mr fong wants to make everyones life difficult
STRING: "This is a string", 'Single quotes arent strings because mr fong hates you'
BOOLEAN: TRUE, FALSE
DATE: 04/06/1989 (dd/mm/yyyy)
```

`CONSTANT`
Syntax: `CONSTANT <'variable' name> = <value>`
Constants don't exist in python,  thus making this very useful to our learning
```C
CONSTANT Mr_Fong = "Asshole"  //You do not have to declare a constant before you assign a value to it for some reason
CONSTANT My_Uni_L1R5 = 69
CONSTANT School_Budget = 0
```
