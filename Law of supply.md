# Law of supply

The [[Law of Demand]] states that when the price of a good rises, its quantity supplied will rise. When itâ€™s price falls, the quantity supplied will fall too, ceteris paribus. 

There is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied. Diagrammatically, this can be shown as the supply curve having a positive gradient.
