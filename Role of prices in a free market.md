# Role of prices in a free market

## Signaling function
Price changes send contrasting signals to consumers and producers about whether to enter or leave a market. 
Rising prices give a #signal to consumers to reduce quantity demanded or withdraw from a market completely, and they give a signal to potential producers to enter a market. 
Conversely, falling prices give a positive message to consumers to enter a market while sending a negative signal to producers to leave a market.

## Incentive function
An #incentive is something that motivates a producer or consumer to follow a course of action or to change behavior as it increases their welfare. 
When prices decrease, a consumer has the incentive to boy more, thus increasing his consumption and hence welfare. 
On the other hand, when prices increase, higher potential profits provide the incentive for a producer to sell more, thus raising his total profit and hence welfare.

## Allocative function
Prices serve to direct producers to allocate resources away from overcrowded markets, where there are surpluses, and toward markets that are underserved, where there ares shortages. 
As higher prices could result in higher profitability, producers channel resources from the production of less profitable goods and services to the production of more profitable goods and services. 
In this way, prices enable scarce resources to be allocated among competing uses. 

## Rationing function
Prices also serve to ration goods and services to consumers who are the most willing and able to pay for them
