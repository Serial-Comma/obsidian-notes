# Tutition industry in China
2021:XingDengQiang Tutition Agency
-> 80,000 sets of chairs and tables donated to rural schools ($160)
-> No weekend tuition unless it is non profit
-> Tuition agency worth $256 billion yuan  (divide by 5 for SGD)
-> Dropped 80% after ban
->Reduce stress/academic pressure on Chinese students
**Question**
1) Govt's right to interviene in private enterprises
2) Effect of such measures
3) Ironically, tuition becomes another set

MOE:
- Singapore tuition agency worth $1.4B SGD
- Understand parents concern (good intentions and ambition)


HK, JP, SK:
- Famous for cram schools
- tutors who are celebs

Other countries might take regulations from China as reference 

Is tution a real solution to students for improving their aecha
or is it just adding more stress?
