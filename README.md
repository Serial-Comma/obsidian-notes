## How to use:

If on Windows:

1) Open PowerShell by pressing Win and type “PowerShell”. Right click the program, and press ‘Run as Administrator’.

2) If you’re actually following this, it's likely you don’t have `git`. Type this into the PowerShell Window:
```
winget install git.git
```
Follow the instructions of the wizard that pops up. It might take a while, for me, it took 5 mins.

3) After installation is complete, close PowerShell and open it again as a normal user. Do **not** open it as admin this time. You can do this the same way by pressing Win and typing “powershell”, but left-clicking the application instead of right-clicking.
4) Type the following commands:
```
git clone 
```
6)
