# Factors affecting supply
###### These non-price determinants cause the supply curve to shift left or right. 

Supply increases → Curve shifts rightwards
Supply decreases → Curve shifts leftwards

### Change in input Prices
→Increase in price of factor inputs (like labor or rent) 
→ Increase cost of production 
→ Decrease production profitablity 
→ **Level of output producers are willing and able to produce at each price level decreases** 
→ Decreases supply of good _cetris paribus_ → Supply curve shifts to the **left**

Similarly,

→Decrease in price of inputs  
→ Decrese in cost of production 
→ Increase production profitablity  
→ Level of output producers are willing and able to produce at each price increases 
→ Increases supply of the good _cetris paribus_ 
→ Supply curve shifts to **right**

### Change in Technology
→ Improvement in Technolgy
→ Higher productivity (more output produced with same amount of resources)
→ Decrease cost of production
→ Increase production profitablity
