# Factors affecting supply
###### These non-price determinants cause the supply curve to shift left or right. 

Supply increases → Curve shifts rightwards
Supply decreases → Curve shifts leftwards

_for everything below assume cetris paribus_

### Change in input Prices
→Increase in price of factor inputs (like labor or rent) 
→ Increase cost of production 
→ Decrease profitablity 
→ **Level of output producers are willing and able to produce at each price level decreases** 
→ Decreases supply 
→ Supply curve shifts left

Similarly,

→Decrease in price of inputs  
→ Decrese in cost of production 
→ Increase profitablity  
→ Level of output producers are willing and able to produce at each price increases 
→ Increases supply 
→ Supply curve shifts right

### Change in Technology
→ Improvement in Technology
→ Higher productivity (more output produced with same amount of resources)
→ Decrease cost of production
→ Increase profitablity 
→ Increases supply 
→ Supply curve shifts right

Example: Adopting digital systems that integrate machines, computers and humans → Enhances productivity of firms → Lower cost of production → Increase profitablity → Increase supply of good

### Government policies
→ Indirect subsidies (grants) by govenment
→ Decrease cost of production 
→ Increase profitablity
→ Increase supply
→ Supply curve shifts right

→ Indirect taxes by government
→ Increase cost of production as producer will incur additional costs of paying the tax
→ Decrease profitablity
→ Decrease supply 
→ Supply curve shifts left

### Number and size of firms
→ New firms enter 
→ Supply increases

→ Increase in size of firms
→ Increase industry’s capacity
→ Supply increases

## Price of Related goods:

### Price of goods in joint supply
Goods in joint supply are when the production of one good leads to the production of another good. Increase in supply for one good → Increase in supply for the other good
