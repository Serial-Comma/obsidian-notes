# Factors affecting [[price elasticity]] of [[demand]]
### Availability of substitutes
Greater availability of substitutes -> Increased price elasticity

Example: 
A petrol kiosk in the middle with nowhere (no competition) -> Less price elastic
A petrol kiosk with lots of competition -> More price elastic

### Closeness of substitutes
Greater closeness of substitutes -> Increased price elasticity

Example:
Taste of sugar is similar regardless of brand of sugar -> High price elasticity
Scent of Perfume is likely to be different depending on brand -> Low price elasticity

#### Definition of Good
Narrower the definition of  good -> Greater [[#Availability of substitutes]] -> Greater price elasticity

Example:
Specific brand of Coffee like Nescafe -> Many close substitutes in other brands -> Greater price elasticity 

Coffee in general -> Fewer close substitutes as other beverages like tea, cocoa drinks, milk and soft drinks taste significantly different -> weak substitutes -> Lower price elasticity


### Time to respond to price changes
It takes time for consumers to recognize and to respond fully to a change in price of a good and to change their spending habits, and this time is used to:
- gather information, such as whether the price change is going to last 
- discover alternatives before altering their consumption patterns in response to a change in price
 
Example:
- Price of oil increases.
Short term impact -> $Q_{D}$  of oil does not fall (significantly) as people do not immediately cut down on their habits or switch to more fuel-efficient cars
Long term impact -> Consumers switch their behavior by driving less or switching to more fuel efficient cars -> $Q_{D}$ of oil decreases

Therefore, 
Longer time to respond -> Greater price elasticity
Shorter time to respond -> Lower price elasticity

### Degree of necessity
Greater degree of necessity -> Lower price elasticity

When consumers are faced with price increases, consumers are more likely to cut back on their wants instead of their needs, causing the price elasticity of their wants to be lower.

[[Addictive goods]] like cigarettes and narcotic drugs are more likely to have a higher degree of necessity by those who are addicted to them, and have very inelastic demand.

### Proportion of income
Larger proportion of income spent -> Consumers more likely to shop around for cheaper substitutes -> Higher price elasticity

For example,
If there is a 10% increase in the price of different goods, the absolute increase in price faced by consumers is larger for an expensive good than for a cheaper good. 
Expensive goods -> Higher price elasticity
Cheaper goods -> Lower price elasticity
