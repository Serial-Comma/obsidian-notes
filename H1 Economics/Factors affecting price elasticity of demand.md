# Factors affecting [[price elasticity]] of [[demand]]
### Availability of substitutes
Greater availability of substitutes -> Increased price elasticity

Example: 
A petrol kiosk in the middle with nowhere (no competition) -> Less price elastic
A petrol kiosk with lots of competition -> More price elastic

### Closeness of substitutes
Greater closeness of substitutes -> Increased price elasticity

Example:
Taste of sugar is similar regardless of brand of sugar -> High price elasticity
Scent of Perfume is likely to be different depending on brand -> Low price elasticity

#### Definition of Good
Narrower the definition of  good -> Greater [[#Availability of substitutes]] -> Greater price elasticity

Example:
Specific brand of Coffee like Nescafe -> Many close substitutes in other brands -> Greater price elasticity 

Coffee in general -> Fewer close substitutes as other beverages like tea, cocoa drinks, milk and soft drinks taste significantly different -> weak substitutes -> Lower price elasticity
