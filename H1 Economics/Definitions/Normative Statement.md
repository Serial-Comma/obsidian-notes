# Normative Statement
A [[Normative Statement]] contains value judgement, It is a statement of value: a statement of what ought or ought not to be, about whether something is good or bad, desirable or undesirable. Since normative statements involve value judgements or subjective feelings, they cannot be proved or disproved by merely looking at evidence. 

Example:
â€˜The rising price of crude oil is harmful to countries'
'The government should not raise taxes on alcohol'
