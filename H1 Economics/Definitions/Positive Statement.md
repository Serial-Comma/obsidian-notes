# Positive Statement
A [[Positive Statement]] is an objective statement whose accuracy can be tested. It may be True or False, but importantly its accuracy can be verified.

Example: 
‘The rising price in crude oil on world markets will lead to an increase in cycling to work’
‘If the government raises taxes on alcohol, this will lead to a fall in profits of the brewers’
