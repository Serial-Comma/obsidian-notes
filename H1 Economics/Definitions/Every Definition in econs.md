Ceteris paribus assumption: Assuming all other factors remain unchanged

Rationality: Economic agents make decisions to maximise self-interest by weighing the marginal benefit and marginal cost of any activity

Positive statement: An objective statement whose accuracy can be tested by looking at evidence

Normative statement: A statement that contains value judgement and cannot be proved or disproved by looking at evidence

Factors of production: Resources that are used in the production of goods and services

Land: A factor of production that encompasses all the natural resources available

Labour: Human beings as factors of production

Capital: Man-made goods used to produce other goods or services over a period of time

Entrepreneurship: The factor of production that takes overall responsibility for the decision-making process in the firm so that the other factors of production (land, labour and capital) can be combined into a good or service

Scarcity: A situation where human wants are unlimited whereas the resources available to satisfy these wants are limited

Opportunity cost: The value of the next best alternative forgone to satisfy a particular want

Production Possibility Curve: The PPC shows all the combinations of two goods that a country can produce within a given time period, with all its resources fully and efficiently utilised at a given state of technology

Productive efficiency: A situation where goods and services are produced at the lowest possible average cost of production

Allocative efficiency: A situation where resources are allocated to produce a combination of goods and services that maximises social welfare

## Chapter 2.1

Demand: The quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at every price level, ceteris paribus

Law of demand: The law of demand states that when the price of a good rises, its quantity demanded will fall and vice versa, ceteris paribus

Law of diminishing marginal utility: The law of diminishing marginal utility states that beyond a certain point of consumption, as more and more units of a good or service are consumed, the additional utility a consumer derives from successive units decreases

Normal good: A good whose demand rise as people's income rise, ceteris paribus

Inferior good: A good whose demand falls as people's income rise, ceteris paribus

Substitutes: Goods which are considered to be alternatives to each other

Complements: Goods that when consumed together, gives rise to a higher combined utility than if they were consumed individually

Derived demand: The demand for goods which are not demanded for its own sake but is used to facilitate the production of another

Supply: The quantity of the good that producers are willing and able to sell at every price level, ceteris paribus

Law of supply: The law of supply states that when the price of a good rises, its quantity supplied will rise. When its price falls, the quantity supplied will fall too, ceteris paribus

Joint supply: Goods are in joint supply when the production of one good leads to the production of the other good.

Competitive supply: Goods in competitive supply compete for the use of the same inputs

Price mechanism: The price mechanism describes the means by which consumers and producers interact to determine the allocation of scarce resources between competing uses

Shortage: It is a situation which exists at any price below equilibrium price where quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied

Surplus: It is a situation which exists at any price above the equilibrium price where quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded


## Chapter 2.1 Part 2

Price elasticity of demand: PED measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price, ceteris paribus

Consumer expenditure: The total amount of money that consumers spend on a good or service

Producer revenue: The total amount of money that producers receive from the sale of a good or service

Price elasticity of supply: PES measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a good to a change in price, ceteris paribus

## Chapter 2.1 Part 3

Equity: The situation where the distribution of economic welfare is fair
