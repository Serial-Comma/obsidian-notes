## Chapter 1

Ceteris paribus assumption: Assuming all other factors remain unchanged

Rationality: Economic agents make decisions to maximise self-interest by weighing the marginal benefit and marginal cost of any activity

Positive statement: An objective statement whose accuracy can be tested by looking at evidence

Normative statement: A statement that contains value judgement and cannot be proved or disproved by looking at evidence

Factors of production: Resources that are used in the production of goods and services

Land: A factor of production that encompasses all the natural resources available

Labour: Human beings as factors of production

Capital: Man-made goods used to produce other goods or services over a period of time

Entrepreneurship: The factor of production that takes overall responsibility for the decision-making process in the firm so that the other factors of production (land, labour and capital) can be combined into a good or service

Scarcity: A situation where human wants are unlimited whereas the resources available to satisfy these wants are limited

Opportunity cost: The value of the next best alternative forgone to satisfy a particular want

Production Possibility Curve: The PPC shows all the combinations of two goods that a country can produce within a given time period, with all its resources fully and efficiently utilised at a given state of technology

Productive efficiency: A situation where goods and services are produced at the lowest possible average cost of production

Allocative efficiency: A situation where resources are allocated to produce a combination of goods and services that maximises social welfare

## Chapter 2.1

Demand: The quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at every price level, ceteris paribus

Law of demand: The law of demand states that when the price of a good rises, its quantity demanded will fall and vice versa, ceteris paribus

Law of diminishing marginal utility: The law of diminishing marginal utility states that beyond a certain point of consumption, as more and more units of a good or service are consumed, the additional utility a consumer derives from successive units decreases

Normal good: A good whose demand rise as people's income rise, ceteris paribus

Inferior good: A good whose demand falls as people's income rise, ceteris paribus

Substitutes: Goods which are considered to be alternatives to each other

Complements: Goods that when consumed together, gives rise to a higher combined utility than if they were consumed individually

Derived demand: The demand for goods which are not demanded for its own sake but is used to facilitate the production of another

Supply: The quantity of the good that producers are willing and able to sell at every price level, ceteris paribus

Law of supply: The law of supply states that when the price of a good rises, its quantity supplied will rise. When its price falls, the quantity supplied will fall too, ceteris paribus

Joint supply: Goods are in joint supply when the production of one good leads to the production of the other good.

Competitive supply: Goods in competitive supply compete for the use of the same inputs

Price mechanism: The price mechanism describes the means by which consumers and producers interact to determine the allocation of scarce resources between competing uses

Shortage: It is a situation which exists at any price below equilibrium price where quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied

Surplus: It is a situation which exists at any price above the equilibrium price where quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded


## Chapter 2.1 Part 2

Price elasticity of demand: PED measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price, ceteris paribus

Consumer expenditure: The total amount of money that consumers spend on a good or service

Producer revenue: The total amount of money that producers receive from the sale of a good or service

Price elasticity of supply: PES measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a good to a change in price, ceteris paribus

## Chapter 2.1 Part 3

Equity: The situation where the distribution of economic welfare is fair

Income inequality: The degree to which income is distributed unequally in an economy or population

Indirect taxes: Taxes imposed by the government on each unit of output produced or transacted

Direct taxes: Taxes imposed by the government directly on the wealth or income of either the consumer or the producer

Progressive direct taxes: Taxes imposed directly on wealth or income where the higher income earners pay a larger percentage of tax than lower income earners

Indirect subsidies: A grant given by the government to encourage the production or consumption of a good or service

Quota: A legal restriction on the quantity of goods or services that can be produced or transacted in a market. For it to have an impact, it has to be implemented below the equilibrium quantity

Ban: A quoter where the output limit is set to zero

Price ceiling: The legal maximum price at which a good can be sold. For it have an impact, the price needs to be set below the free market equilibrium price

Price floor: The legal minimum price on which a good can be sold. For it to have an impact, it needs to be set above the free market equilibrium price.

Minimum wages: The minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract

Direct provision: The situation where the government provides the good or service by either producing it or outsourcing production to a private firm which can produce it at a lower cost

Transfer payments: Money transferred from one person to another without transactions taking place. Transfer payments are a form of redistributive policy which aim to transfer part of the income gains enjoyed by higher-income earners to the lower-income segments or the population

## Theme 2.2 

Market failure: The failure of the free market to allocate resources efficiently

Dynamic efficiency: Involves improving allocative and productive efficiency over time. Is associated with innovation within a market an improvement in both the range of choice for consumers and also the quality of products

Negative externalities: Spillover costs to third parties who are not directly involved in the consumption or production of the good or service itself

Positive externalities: Spillover benefits to third parties who are not directly involved in the consumption or production of the good or service itself

Imperfect information: A case of information failure, where consumers/producers do not have correct or complete information about the costs/benefits of consuming or producing a good

Non-excludability: A situation in which it is impossible or very costly to exclude non-payers from the consumption or use of a good or service once it has been provided

Non-rivalry: The consumption or use of a good or service by once consumer does not reduce the quantity and/or quality available for others

Non-rejectability: The inability of consumers to refuse the consumption of a good once it has been produced
