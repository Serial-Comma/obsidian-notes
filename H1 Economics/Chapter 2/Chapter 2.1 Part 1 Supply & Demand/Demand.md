# Demand
Demand is given as the quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase in a given time period at every price level, ceteris paribus. 

## Law of Demand
The Law of Demand states that when the price of a good **rises**, its quantity demanded will **fall** and vice versa, ceteris paribus. 

There is an **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded. Diagrammatically, a demand curve has negative gradient.
