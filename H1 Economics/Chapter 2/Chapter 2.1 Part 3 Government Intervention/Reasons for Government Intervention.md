# Reasons for Government Intervention

## Achieve efficiency
Some goods when left to the free market do not have [[allocative efficiency]] or [[productive efficiency]], so the government must correct these inefficiencies in order to achieve efficiency.

## Reduce inequity
Sometimes welfare distribution is unfair: Rich enjoy more than proportional amount of country's resources compared to poor who lack access to necessities. Government intervenes to redistribute welfare from rich to poor to reduce inequity. 

## Raise tax revenue 
Government expenditure is mainly funded through tax revenue, hence funding from taxes to implement things like subsidies is needed as a rational decision maker.
