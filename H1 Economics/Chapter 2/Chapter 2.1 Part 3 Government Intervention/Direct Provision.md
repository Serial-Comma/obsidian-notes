# Direct provision
Is where the government provides a good or service by either **producing it themselves** or **outsourcing it to a private firm** to produce at a lower cost. 
It can be provisioned at either a **subsidised rate** or **free of charge**, to ensure **all income levels can access these essential goods and services.**

## Benefits
- Prices are lower compared to if left to the free market, decreasing **inequity** for essentials
- Compared to subsidies, outcomes are 
	- more certain
	- achieved faster

## Limitations
- Fall in [[dynamic efficiency]], leading to a possible fall in quantity in long run, due to lack of incentive to innovate and reduce costs
- If government has imperfect information, they may produce too much or too little of the good, leading to lower [[allocative efficiency]]

## Unintended Consequences
