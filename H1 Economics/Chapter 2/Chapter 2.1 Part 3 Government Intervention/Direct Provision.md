# Direct provision
- Is where the government provides a good or service by either **producing it themselves** or **outsourcing it to a private firm** to produce at a lower cost. 
- It can be provisioned at either a **subsidised rate** or **free of charge**.
- Ensures **all income levels** can access these essential goods and services.

## Benefits
- Prices are lower compared to if left to the free market, decreasing **inequity** for essentials
- Compared to subsidies, outcomes are 
	- more certain
	- achieved faster

## Limitations
- Lack of incentive to improve production leads to a possible **fall in quantity** in long run, due to lack of incentive to innovate and reduce costs
- If government has imperfect information, they may produce too much or too little of the good, leading to lower [[allocative efficiency]]

## Unintended Consequences
- Lack of profit motive means a lack of incentives to reduce costs, leading to lower [[productive efficiency]]
- Lack of competition also means lower [[productive efficiency]]
- Politics and electoral pressures may make the government over-allocate resources above the social optimal level, leading to lower [[allocative efficiency]]
