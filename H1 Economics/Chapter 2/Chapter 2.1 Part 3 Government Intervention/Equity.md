# Equity

Equity is when there is fairness in distribution in economic welfare. A good can be allocatively efficient but not equitable. 

Inequity usually occurs when the market for necessities become inaccessible to lower income consumers if left to the free market.

Equity issues really only matter if the good in question is a *need* rather than a *want*
