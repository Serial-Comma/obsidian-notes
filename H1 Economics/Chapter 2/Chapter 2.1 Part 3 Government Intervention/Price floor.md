## Price support policy
Sometimes the government buys up the surplus to prevent it from depressing prices using government spending. 
If used, **PR definitely increases**

## Benefits
- Protects producer's revenues, prevents them from falling and have more stable prices
- Increases incentive to continue to produce good
-  If used with PSP, PR definitely increases

## Limitations
- With no PSP, firms may evade price control and cut their prices to reduce surplus, reducing effectiveness of price floor

## Unintended consequences
- Using a PSP causes an opportunity cost incurred for budget spent
- Greater inequity if low income groups cannot afford necessities
- Cause productive inefficiency as firms are less incentivised to cut costs as their revenue is protected by high price
- Cause allocative inefficiency as surplus goods have additional costs to be stored and may end up going to waste
