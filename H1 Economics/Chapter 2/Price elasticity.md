# Price elasticity

## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
Measures the **degree of responsiveness** of quantity demanded of a good to price changes

Price elastic -> Change in price causes **more than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Gentler slope)
Price inelastic -> Change in price causes a **less than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Steeper slope)

#### Special demand curves
- A **perfectly price elastic** demand curve is horizontal, where an increase in the price of a good causes demand for it to become basically zero. Consumers are prepared to buy it at its existing price, and none at all at even slightly higher price. Examples include [[homogenous goods]] like money changers. PED = âˆž.

- A **perfectly price inelastic** demand curve is vertical, where a change in the price of a good has brings about no change in quantity demanded. Consumers are willing and able to buy the good at any price. Examples include BTS tickets and pancakes sold in school. PED = 0.

## Price elasticity of supply
Measures the **degree of responsiveness** to quantity supplied of a good to a change in its price

Price elastic -> Change in price causes a **more than proportionate change** in quantity supplied (Gentler slope)
Price inelastic -> Change in price causes a **less than proportionate change** in quantity supplied (Steeper slope)
