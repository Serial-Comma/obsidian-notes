# Application of [[Price elasticity]]

## Application of PED
If a profit maximising firm expects the demand to be
Price inelastic -> Increase price of its good
Price elastic -> Decrease price of its good

### Limitations

#### Difficult to estimate magnitude of elasticities
 Smaller firms typically do not have resources to collect data on its own price and quantity sold, making them unable to make informed business decisions, preventing them from leveraging on the PED to maximise revenue.

#### Estimates based on past data
Even if they have accurate data, "past performance is not indicative of future results", and conditions could have changed significantly in the business environment since then. However, using this information to make decisions is better than no information at all.

#### No information of cost changes
When PED is applied, the assumption is for them to maximise their PR, which is inaccurate as they want to maximise profits.
