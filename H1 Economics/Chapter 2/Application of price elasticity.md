# Application of [[Price elasticity]]

## Application of PED
If a profit maximising firm expects the demand to be
Price inelastic -> Increase price of its good
Price elastic -> Decrease price of its good

### Limitations

#### Difficult to estimate magnitude of elasticities
 Smaller firms typically do not have resources to collect data on its own price and quantity sold, making them unable to make informed business decisions, preventing them from leveraging on the PED to maximise revenue.

#### Estimates based on past data
Even if they have accurate data, "past performance is not indicative of future results", and conditions could have changed significantly in the business environment since then. However, using this information to make decisions is better than no information at all.

#### No information of cost changes
When PED is applied, the assumption is for them to maximise their PR, which is inaccurate as they want to maximise profits. A strategy which may increase revenue may no longer be attractive if the cost to implement outweighs the increase in revenue. PED tells us nothing about how cost changes when firms make a decision. 

#### Ceteris paribus assumption
The ceteris paribus assumption does not hold true in the real world, as in reality many different factors affecting demand for a good can change simultaneously. There could be other non-price factors affecting the demand for a good, making decisions based on the ceteris paribus assumption inaccurate.

## Application of PES
Since firms usually control their own supply, they likely have perfect information on their own PES, as opposed to their
