	# Price elasticity

## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
Measures the **degree of responsiveness** of quantity demanded of a good to price changes

Price elastic -> Change in price causes **more than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Gentler slope)
Price inelastic -> Change in price causes a **less than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Steeper slope)

#### Special demand curves
- A **perfectly price elastic** demand curve is horizontal, where an increase in the price of a good causes demand for it to become basically zero. Consumers are prepared to buy it at its existing price, and none at all at even slightly higher price. Examples include [[homogenous goods]] like money changers. PED = ∞.

- A **perfectly price inelastic** demand curve is vertical, where a change in the price of a good has brings about no change in quantity demanded. Consumers are willing and able to buy the good at any price. Examples include BTS tickets and pancakes sold in school. PED = 0.

## Price elasticity of supply
Measures the **degree of responsiveness** to quantity supplied of a good to a change in its price

Price elastic -> Change in price causes a **more than proportionate change** in quantity supplied (Gentler slope)
Price inelastic -> Change in price causes a **less than proportionate change** in quantity supplied (Steeper slope)

![[PES effects on gradient.excalidraw]]

#### Special supply curves
- A perfectly price elastic supply curve is horizontal, where an increase/decrease in price leads to the quantity supplied become basically zero. Producers are prepared to supply infinite amounts of the good at the current price and none at all when it is changed. PES = ∞
- A perfectly price inelastic supply curve is vertical, where quantity supplied is completely unresponsive to price changes. Producers are willing to supply the quantity of the good no matter what price it is at. Examples include antiques and famous art pieces, or highly perishable goods like fresh fish. PES = 0.
