# Price elasticity

## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
Measures the **degree of responsiveness** of quantity demanded of a good to price changes

Price elastic -> Change in price causes **more than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Gentler slope)
Price inelastic -> Change in price causes a **less than proportionate change** in quantity demanded (Steeper slope)

#### Special demand curves
- A **perfectly price elastic** demand curve is horizontal, where an increase in the price of a good causes demand for it to become basically zero. Consumers are prepared to buy it at its existing price, and none at all at even slightly higher price. PED = âˆž 

- A **perfectly price inelastic** demand curve is vertical, where a change in the price of a good has brings about no change in quantity demanded. Consumers are willing and able to buy the good at any price. PED = 0
