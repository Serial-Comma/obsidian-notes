# Factors affecting price elasticity of supply
### Length and complexity of production process
Longer and more complex process -> More price inelastic

Textiles production has a simple process (e.g. basic production facilities, unskilled labour, etc..) -> More price elastic

### Stock/Inventory levels

Example: 
Processed food can be stored for longer -> Able to react to price ch
