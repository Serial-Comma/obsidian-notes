# Factors affecting price elasticity of [[supply]]
### Length and complexity of production process
Longer and more complex process -> More price inelastic

Example: 
Car production has a long and complex process (e.g. specialised equipment, skilled labour, etc.) -> More rice inelastic
Textiles production has a simple process (e.g. basic production facilities, unskilled labour, etc..) -> More price elastic

### Stock/Inventory levels
Good has a longer shelf life -> More price elastic

Example: 
Processed food can be stored for longer -> Able to react to price changes by releasing or holding back stocks -> Price elastic
Fresh food does not have a long shelf life -> Unable to react to price changes by releasing or holding back stocks -> price elastic

### Availability and Substitutability of inputs
Factors of production of one good can easily be adjusted to produce a different good ->
