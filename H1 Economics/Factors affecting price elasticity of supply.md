# Factors affecting price elasticity of [[supply]]
### Length and complexity of production process
Longer and more complex process -> More price inelastic

Example: 
Car production has a long and complex process (e.g. specialised equipment, skilled labour, etc.) -> More rice inelastic
Textiles production has a simple process (e.g. basic production facilities, unskilled labour, etc..) -> More price elastic

### Stock/Inventory levels
Good has a longer shelf life -> More price elastic

Example: 
Processed food can be stored for longer -> Able to react to price changes by releasing or holding back stocks -> Price elastic
Fresh food does not have a long shelf life -> Unable to react to price changes by releasing or holding back stocks -> More price inelastic

### Availability and Substitutability of inputs
Factors of production of one good can swiftly be adjusted to produce a different good -> Able to swiftly change quantity supplied when price changes -> More price elastic

Example:
Printing press can swiftly switch from printing magazines to cards -> Able to increase quantity supplied of cards if price of cards increases -> More price elastic

#### Spare capacity
Some firms have idle resources to increase flexibility in reacting to price changes, making them price elastic. 

Firms have spare capacity -> Price increases -> Firms react by using unused machines -> Increase quantity supplied -> Price elastic
Firms operate at full capacity -> Price increases -> Firm cannot increase production easily -> Unable to increase quantity supplied -> Price inelastic

### Time to respond to price changes
Since it takes time for firms to adjust [[factors of production]] to respond to price changes, 
Short run- Supply is fixed as it relies on existing stocks -> Price inelastic
Long run- Supply is reliant of factors of production which are variable -> Price elastic

Example:
Supply of fresh fish in a single day depends of size of that specific day's catch -> Unable to change supply in such short notice in response to that day's price changes-> Price inelastic
Supply of fresh fish in the long run can be increased by acquiring more fishing boats/increasing other factors of production in response to price increase -> Price elastic

Despite this, the supply is not perfectly price inelastic in the short run as firms can increase
