# Factors affecting demand
A change in demand is caused by changes in non-price determinants. 

Increase in demand → Shift in demand curve to the right
Decrease in demand → Shift in demand curve to the left

_for everything below assume ceteris paribus_

### Tastes and preferences
Tastes and preferences are influenced by reasons such as advertising, changes in product quality and/or fashion trends/fads.

→Increased advertising/improvement in product quality/product currently in fashion
→ Influences tastes and preferences favorably 
→ Demand for good increases

Weather conditions can also cause demand to change in favor of a good, such as ice cream during summer.

### Level of income
Generally,
People’s income rises → Purchasing power increases → Demand for most goods increase
This applies for [[Normal Goods]]

But there are exceptions for [[Inferior goods]], such as poorer cuts of meat.
People’s income rises→ Want to switch to better quality goods → Spend less and reduce demand for [[Inferior Goods]]

### Amount of Derived Demand
Derived Demand is the demand for goods which are not demanded for its own use, but is used to facilitate the production of another. For example, the demand for leather is derived from the demand for leather wallets, so

Demand for leather goods increases → Demand for leather increases

### Ease of Acquiring Credit
Consumers borrow to finance big purchases like property, furniture, household appliances, cars, holidays and education. 
Easier credit conditions (like lower [[Interest Rates]]) → Increased demand for all [[G&S]]
Relaxation of financing rules → Increased demand

### Population
Increase in population size → Increased demand for all [[G&S]] 

Changes in population structure also affect demand patterns.
Aging population → Increase in demand for goods consumed by elderly → Decrease in goods consumed by young people

### Expectations of future prices
Expected price increase → Buyers bring forward purchases to buy more before price increases → Current demand increases

Expected price decrease → Buyers hold back purchases to only buy when price is lower → Current demand decreases

These speculations often exacerbate price fluctuations and volatility in a market, and can be witnessed in both [[Asset Markets]] and [[Commodity Markets]]. Yes, speculations also involve the purchase of goods to earn a profit from its sale later if its price increases (im looking at you GPU scalpers).

### Exchange Rates
Exchange rates are the rate one country’s currency can be exchanged for another currency.

Appreciation/Strengthening of domestic currency → Imported substitutes become cheaper → Decrease in demand for locally produced goods

For example, 
→Japanese Yen appreciates 
→ European cars are cheaper to import 
→ Consumers switch from locally manufactured cars to European-manufactured cars
→ Demand for locally-manufactured cars decreases

### Government policies
Example: 
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) imposed regulations that limit car loans for some categories of private cars to no more than 70% of the purchase price and the repayment period to no more than 7 years. These policies cause some consumers to no longer be able to purchase cars, decreasing the demand for cars.

## Price of related goods:

### Price of substitute goods
Substitute goods are goods in competitive demand. 
Increase in price of one good → Increase in demand for other good 

For example, Coke and Pepsi are similar, so 
Price of Pepsi rises → Consumers of Pepsi Switch to Coke → Increased demand for Coke

### Price of complementary goods
Complementary goods are goods in joint demand. 
Increase in price of one good → Decrease in demand for the other good

For example, if Matches and Cigarettes are in joint demand, so
Price of cigarettes increases → $Q_{D}$ of cigarettes decreases → $Q_{D}$ of matches also decreases
