# Factors affecting demand
A change in demand is caused by changes in non-price determinants. 

Increase in demand → Shift in demand curve to the right
Decrease in demand → Shift in demand curve to the left

### Tastes and preferences
Tastes and preferences are influenced by reasons such as advertising, changes in product quality and/or fashion trends/fads.

→Increased advertising/improvement in product quality/product currently in fashion
→ Influences tastes and preferences favorably 
→ Demand for good increases

Weather conditions can also cause demand to change in favor of a good, such as ice cream during summer.

### Level of income
Generally,
People’s income rises → Purchasing power increases → Demand for most goods increase
This applies for [[Normal Goods]]

But there are exceptions for [[Inferior goods]], such as poorer cuts of meat.
People’s income rises→ Want to switch to better quality goods → Spend less and reduce demand for [[Inferior Goods]]

### Amount of Derived Demand
Derived Demand is the demand for goods which are not demanded for its own use, but is used to facilitate the production of another. For example, the demand for leather is derived from the demand for leather wallets, so

Demand for leather goods increases → Demand for leather increases

### Ease of Acquiring Credit
Consumers borrow to finance big purchases like property, furniture, household appliances, cars, holidays and education. 
Easier credit conditions (like lower [[Interest Rates]]) → Increased demand for all [[G&S]]
Relaxation of financing rules → Increased demand

### Population
Increase in population size → Increased demand for all [[G&S]] 

Changes in population structure also affect demand patterns.
Aging population → Increase in demand for goods consumed by elderly → Decrease in goods consumed by young people

### Expectations of future prices
Expected price increase → Buyers bring forward purchases to buy more before price increases → Current demand increases

Expected price decrease → Buyers hold back purchases to only buy when price is lower → Current demand decreases
