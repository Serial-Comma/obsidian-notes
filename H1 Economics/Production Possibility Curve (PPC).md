There are 3 possibilities of a point on the PPC:

### On the border of the PPC
It is attainable and efficient
- Have to make a choice between the different combinations on the PPC. 

### Within the PPC
It is attainable but inefficient

### Outside the PPC
It is unattainable
- Shows Scarcity and that it cannot be solved, only alleviated

Downward sloping nature of PPC shows [[Opportunity cost]].
For example, when an economy moves from point C to point D, it gives up 10 million units of capital goods to produce 5 million units of consumer goods. 
The [[Opportunity cost]] of producing the additional 5 million units of consumer goods is the 10 million units of capital goods.
